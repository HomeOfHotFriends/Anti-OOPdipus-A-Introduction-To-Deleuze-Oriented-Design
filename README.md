**Deleuze-Oriented Design (DoD)**
**Overview**
Deleuze-Oriented Design (DoD) is a revolutionary programming paradigm, framework, and set of design principles inspired by the philosophical concepts of Gilles Deleuze and FÃ©lix Guattari. It merges the performance, modularity, 
and scalability of Data-Oriented Design (DoD) with innovative tools to map complex, transformative relationships. By emphasizing representation over abstraction, DoD offers a unique approach to deterministic 
emergent systems, collaborative programming, and accessible game development by focusing on mapping flows and intensities rather than encapsulation, leveraging Deleuze and Guattari's concepts like rhizomes, flows, and multiplicities to rethink how systems interact.


**This project serves as a foundation for the development of:**
The first work on DoD, in the form of a Thesis (written under my own supervision without university involvement). This thesis doubles as the documentation for a game prototype that illustrates the workflow, if not the 'under the hood' workings of DoD

A scaffolding of programming philosophies and philisophical theory in order to communicate the paradigm of DoD

A theoretical programming language (RHIZE) designed to solve core challenges in programming and game development.

Tools and engines that privilege modularity, scalability, and collaboration.


**Key Goals**
1. Enabling Deterministic Emergent Systems
  Emergent systems are notoriously difficult to implement while maintaining determinism. DoD tackles this by introducing tools for mapping complex, transformative relationships, enabling developers to:
    Model flows and intensities with deterministic results.
    Create systems that remain predictable while fostering complexity.
2. Fostering Collaboration in Programming
  Collaboration in traditional programming can be challenging due to siloed tools and limited abstractions. DoD aims to:
    Promote open-source cross-collaboration through tools and social network/engine hybrids.
    Provide a shared conceptual framework based on representation rather than opaque encapsulation.
    Allow developers to communicate effectively while working on modular, scalable systems.
3. Lowering the Barriers to Game Development
  Creating games is often complex and time-intensive, even for experienced developers. DoD simplifies this process with:
  -The RHIZE language, offering innovative features like color-coded declarative programming and flow-based design.
  -Abstractions that enhance readability and performance without obscuring complexity.
  -Tools to make Data-Oriented Design accessible and intuitive, enabling both newcomers and professionals to accelerate their workflows.

**Innovative Features of the RHIZE Language:**
 RHIZE is a programming language(s) concept built around:
 - The love of both optimised code and the creative power of abstractions
 - 11 building blocks of programming that treats tranformative-relationships as first class citizens.
 - Color-coded variable types: 
  - - Combine visual and functional clarity by assigning colors to building block types. For example:
  - - - Enemy (Blue) and Position (Purple) can combine into EnemyPosition with unique compiler recognition. Adjanceny will be recognised as an operator, with full operator overloading
  - Flow-based programming:
  - - Simplifies mapping interactions between flows (data pipelines) and the systems or 'machines' that transform them using flow segments.
  - Representation-focused abstraction:
  - - Quickly map out systems visually and conceptually without sacrificing performance.
  - Map-based Seperation of Concerns:
  - - RHIZE features the concepts of MAPS that each provide a unique way of interacting with the building blocks of the language.
  - - Maps are seperated into:
  - - - Substrate Maps:
  - - - - For most users this will be treated as a library, but full customisation will be allowed for the intrepid
  - - - - Treats data as the first class citizen
  - - - - - technical, 'close to the metal' programming of how each of the initial 11 building blocks operate in each map in the other two categories, with the options to create your own or modify existing
  - - - - -Determines how operators function when used in combination with different combinations of the building blocks
  - - - Definition Maps: 
  - - - - Covers the naming, definition, and creation of instances of 5 of the 11 building blocks. These maps basically function as a data-oriented ECS
  - - - - This is where the majority of programmers will do most of their work
  - - - Expression Maps:
  - - - - Declarative-inspired-programming that fully leverages the power of the colour coded system and the utilising the other 6 building blocks to express to express transformative relationships between the instances created in the definition maps
  - - - - This is a powerful programming language in and of itself that prioritises clarity and ease of use
  - - - - These maps are where the majority of designers will do most of their work 

**Theoretical Foundations**
DoD is grounded in philosophical ideas like:

Rhizomes: Non-hierarchical, interconnected systems that grow and evolve.
Flows and intensities: Dynamic relationships between entities, represented as data flows.
Multiplicity: Systems composed of interacting, scalable components.
Contingency: Everything is effected by everything

**Planned Applications**
Programming Tools:
- A modular language and IDE to implement RHIZE concepts.
- Tools for visualizing and managing flows and relationships in large systems
- Game Development:
- Engines and frameworks that simplify deterministic emergent behavior.
- Tools to lower the barrier to entry for new developers while enhancing scalability for professionals.
- Collaborative Platforms:
- Social networks for developers to share, extend, and iterate on modular systems and games.

**Why This Project Matters**
For Developers: A new paradigm for conceptualizing and building deterministic, emergent systems.
For GameDesigners: A (eventual) new language that
For Collaborators: A framework that makes open-source development accessible and effective.
For Gamers: Accelerating the creation of innovative, high-performance games.
